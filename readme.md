# Our Project ideas

## Problem domain
For the domain, we were thinking of making a board game similar to checker or chess 
where players could compete against a computer (or each other?).

## Type of Application


## API documentation link
We were interested in using Swing API, which is helpful for creating front end/GUI applications.

The link is [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?javax/swing/package-summary.html)
